                    <h2>Orion</h2>
                    <p>Orion is one of the largest and most recognizable of the constellations. It is viewable around the world, and has been mentioned by Homer, Virgil, and even the Bible, making it perhaps the most famous constellation. Orion was a massive, supernaturally gifted hunter who was the son of Poseidon. He regularly hunted with Artemis on the island of Crete, and that he was killed either by her bow, or by the sting of the great scorpion, the constellation Scorpius.</p>

                    <h2>Aries</h2>
                    <p>While many constellations have gone through various iterations of mythological stories, Aries has always been the ram. This constellation is one of 12 constellations that form the zodiac — the constellations that straddle the sun’s path across the sky (known in scienctific terms as the ecliptic). In ancient times, that gave the constellations of the zodiac special significance.Aries is the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece.</p>

                    <h2>Cassiopeia</h2>
                    <p>Cassiopeia, in Greek mythology, was a vain queen who often boasted about her beauty. She was the mother of Princess Andromeda, and in contrast to other figures being placed in the sky in honor, Cassiopeia was forced to the heavenly realms as punishment. As the story goes, she boasted that her beauty (or her daughter’s, depending on the story) was greater than that of the sea nymphs. This was quite an offense, she was banned to the sky for all to gawk at.</p>
